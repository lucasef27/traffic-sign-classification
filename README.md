# Traffic Sign Classification

**Traffic sign image classification using deep learning (CNN) and the GTSRB dataset.**

## Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs.  
It uses the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset, applies data preprocessing and augmentation, and trains a model to achieve high accuracy on unseen images.

## Features
- Preprocessing of traffic sign images
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- CNN architecture implemented in TensorFlow/Keras
- Training, validation, and evaluation of the model
- Visualization of results (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix)
- Inference script for new traffic sign images
